	<description>This mod introduces a "growable" crop to be refined into plasteel. 
		Crops take ~30 days to "grow" and products can be refined at a smelter into usable plasteel.
		
		Tested only on version 1.4 as I am too lazy to check out the older versions that I never play.
		Created for myself to learn rimworld modding.
